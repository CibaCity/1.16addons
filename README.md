#INSTALLATION#
This will download as a master.zip file with only 1 folder inside, that folder should be 1.16 additions.
Move the contents of the folder into the top level file. This means you should have assets, pack.png and pack.mcmeta along with the 1.16addonsmaster folder.
DELETE the 1.16addons folder and you should be ready to go.
Just put this over another 1.16 texture pack you might have.
